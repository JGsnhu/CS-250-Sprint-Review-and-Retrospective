# CS-250-Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  I interpret the user needs by being as thorough as possible while gathering information to create the product vision. This can be done through the focus group examples given during the modules of this class. From this user stories are created that are used throughout development, these user stories show the different features the customer would like to see in the product, and also how they would like to interact with these different features. This gives the development team an idea of how to proceed with future work. These user stories can also be updated to refelct changes that the customer requests to help keep the development team updated.
  
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  The best of approach for developing programs, is to gather all appropriate information needed in order to create a accurate product vision. This product vision can then be set as the standard during the development process. The next importanat step is to keep communication open between different parts of the development team as changes come down the line to assure that the product is completed in a timely manner. This can be done in Scrum meetings. These are processes that I hope to include in my future development work wil be scrum meetings, sprint reviews and retropsectives, and managing the backlogs of work to make sure that the team focuses on the tasks that will ensure success in development of the product.
  
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me being a good team member in software means being affective towards product completion. To be an affective team member must keep an open line of communication with other team members, complete their assigned tasks to the best of there abilities, and work well both on their own and as part of a team. There must always be a certain level of professionalism that is that is maintained in the team, and that every team member is treated with respect.
